## Codes:
-- Matlab: the majority part of image analysis and classification

-- Python: use pre-trained models to extract tumor tile features

-- R: to plot KM survival curves

## Usages:
-- step00: pre-processing during our project develompent, you do not need to run this folder for repeating our studies

-- step01: we trained svm classifier to detect tumor regions
