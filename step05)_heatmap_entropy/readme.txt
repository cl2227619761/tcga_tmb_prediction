Under this folder, we tried to use trained SVM to make tmb predictions and generate heatmaps.

a_svm_prediction_scores: make tmb predictions on high and low patients
b_heatmap_generation: generate heatmaps for high and low patients
c_svm_prediction_scores_mid: make tmb predictions on mid patients
d_heatmap_generatation_mid: geneate heatmaps for mid patients
e_tmb_map_entropy: compute shannon entropy for patients
